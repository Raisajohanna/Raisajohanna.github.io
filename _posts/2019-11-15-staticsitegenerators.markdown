It was very easy to understand. After looking through the jekylls home page and looking through the documentation, I got a pretty clear picture of how the tool works. It really helps with the coding and keeps it organized and clean. Easy to make changes to the look and feel of the website.

What type of projects are they suitable for?

A static page is good for smaller companies who need information and maybe campaigns. Ways to connect with them etc. and easy to maintain.
