## Diqus

I used the comment-service [Disqus][Disqus]. It's a plugin that makes it easy to have a comment-functionality on your blogpage. 

## How did I use it?

I put it in my layout for blog-posts. Added the universal embeded code to my html-file for _layouts and file: posts. After the article tag.
I added my disqus-username in my _config.yml. I also added comments: true to all posts.
