## Humans.txt

Is an initiative for knowing the people behind the website. It's a document containing the information about all the different people who have contributed to building the website. 

## How did I do it? 

I placed a human.txt file in the root of the website. I uses the standard humans.txt from Abel Cabans [humans.txt][humans.txt]
