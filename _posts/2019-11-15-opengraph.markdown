## Open graph

Open Graph is a technology first introduced by Facebook. It allows you to present your pageÂ´s on your website with content when someone share's your page. 

## How did I use it?

I downloaded the plugin for jekyll-seo like this. 
 - Wrote the The Jekyll SEO Tag `gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'`in the Gemfile in the root of my site.
 - Then in my _config.yml I put the `plugins: - jekyll-seo-tag`
 - And last I added the shorttag for seo in my head.html so that all the content can be read when someone shares my site.
